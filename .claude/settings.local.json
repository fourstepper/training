Add standalone protocol option and emphasize that\nconsistency matters more than perfect timing.\n\nKey changes:\n- Expanded timing considerations section with both post-exercise and standalone options\n- Added standalone session protocol details\n- Clarified that passive heating alone can induce adaptations\n- Emphasized scheduling flexibility over rigid timing requirements\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

Clarifies that while continuous exposure is optimal, interval\nprotocols can work with proper (passive) cooling strategy.\n\nKey additions:\n- Interval protocol structure: 3x10-15min with passive rest\n- Explains why aggressive cooling reduces effectiveness (core temp <38.5°C)\n- Distinguishes between heat acclimation protocols and traditional Finnish practice\n- Beginner progression path from intervals to continuous exposure\n- Two new research references on interval protocols\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
